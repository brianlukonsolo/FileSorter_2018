# FileSorter_2018
A personal Apache Camel application to sort files into separate folders according to file-type

Given a folder that has a variety of files with different extension types, my program will sort these into separate folders that are named after the extension of each file. For example, "Brian.txt" would be moved to a "txt" folder while "Brian2.pdf" would be moved to a "pdf" folder.

*Work in progress but the basic functionality is there...*
